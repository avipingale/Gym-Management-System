</html> /*The provided HTML document has been updated to create a webpage titled "Fee Structure" with improved styling. Here's a description of the changes and the overall structure of the updated code:

1. **Title**: The webpage title remains "Fee Structure."

2. **Stylesheet**: The `<style>` section has been modified to enhance the styling of the "box" element. The following changes have been made:
   - The padding for the "box" has been adjusted to `20px`, providing more space around its content for a balanced appearance.
   - The `text-align` property is set to `center`, ensuring that the content within the "box" is centered horizontally.
   - A background color (`#0080FF`, a shade of blue) has been added to the "box" to give it a visually appealing background.

3. **JavaScript**: The `<script>` section remains the same and continues to prevent the default context menu from appearing when the user right-clicks on the webpage.

4. **Body Content**: The `<body>` section contains a `<div>` element with the class "box." Inside this "box," there is a single `<img>` element that displays an image named "Fee Structure.png." The following updates have been made to the image:
   - The `alt` attribute has been added to provide alternative text for accessibility purposes.
   - The `width` and `height` attributes have been set to `800` and `400`, respectively, to specify the dimensions of the image.

Overall, the updated HTML document creates a visually improved webpage for displaying fee structure information. The "box" now has a blue background, more balanced padding, and centered content. The image within the "box" maintains its aspect ratio and fits within the specified dimensions. The title of the webpage is "Fee Structure," and right-click functionality is disabled to protect the content.*/
